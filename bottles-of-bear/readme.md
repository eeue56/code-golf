Main story:
Print `<x> bottles of beer on the wall`, starting at 99, ending at 0

If you don't know how it goes look [here](http://www.99-bottles-of-beer.net/lyrics.html)

Plot twist:
Any literals you use must be reversed.

```
Strings: "hello" -> "olleh"
Lists: [1, 2] -> [2, 1]
Numbers: 97 -> 79
Booleans: True -> False
```
