Challange
---------

Write a function that takes in a string and returns the morse code version

The notable thing about this challenge is the Netlogo solutions. [turtlemorse](./turtlemorse.netlogo) abuses the agent model of NetLogo to use the agent-based operations in order to create a dictionary. [mistakemorse](./mistakemorse) is a minified version of a traditional solution.
